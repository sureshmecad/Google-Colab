        " - Test all possible algorithms on your data to see which works best for you. There are both pros and cons to this approach. The pros would be that you would definitely know that one algorithm or a set of algorithms are better choices for your problem statement. The approach is computationally costly when you have huge datasets.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        " - Another approach is to try and understand what the algorithm does before deciding if it is a good fit for your problem or not.
